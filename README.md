# Gabriel_Flask-Profile_Page_Test
This was my attempt at creating a profile page on local host using python's flask module.
In order to run my code, you must download all files to your computer.
Then, the zip files must be uncompressed and converted into file format.
These folders that were just uncompressed should be in the same folder as the rest of the python files.
